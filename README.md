# Sorting-Visualizer
* This Project is a Web Visualization tool for sorting algorithms.
* Created a web application using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize how various sorting algorithms work.
* Here we use 6 sorting algorithms to identify their speed of visualization.
* The Six Algorithms are : -

  -> Bubble Sort
  -> Selection Sort
  -> Insertion Sort
  -> Merge Sort
  -> Quick Sort
  -> Heap Sort

* The Application allows the users to select the sorting algorithm, speed of the visualization and input array elements.
